# Wall-Glider

This repository contains the files needed to build a Wall Glider Robotic System. 

Wall Glider is a  modular omnidirectional robotic assistant that is designed to navigate 
 magnetically attached to walls while following a userâ€™s position and actions. The robot 
 has modular magnetic mechanisms that can be switched and adapted for the robot to be used 
 for different purposes such as lighting, security, medical assistance, tool holding and even
 as a space exploration companion.
